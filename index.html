          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning how to code when i was 19 because i wanted to
            bring my ux designs to life and because i always wanted to create my
            own games. Over time, i have gained a wealth of experience designing
            and developing mobile and web applications

          <h3>UX Design</h3>
          <p>
            I started off as a graphic designer, but upon stumbling into UX
            Design it was love at first sight. From wireframing, designing lo-fi
            and hi-fi mockups, creating user interfaces, and prototyping, I knew
            UX design was meant for me.
